- Maintained all form validation and error messaging

### 2. **Component Updates**

## Component Mapping

### Form Components
- `mat-form-field` → `p-floatLabel` with `input pInputText`
- `mat-select` → `p-dropdown`
- `textarea matInput` → `textarea pTextarea`
- `input[type="number"]` → `p-inputNumber`
- `mat-checkbox` → `p-checkbox`
- `mat-radio-button` → `p-radioButton`

### UI Components
- `mat-card` → `p-card` with templates

- `mat-divider` → `p-divider`
- `mat-expansion-panel` → `p-accordion`

### Button Severities
PrimeNG uses different severity values:
- `primary` (default)

- `warning` is NOT valid (changed to `danger` where needed)

## Forms Migrated

### Step 1: Basic Information

  - Staff list with chips for status

### Step 2: Services
- Service name, duration, description
- Price with currency selection (p-inputNumber with currency mode)
- Image URL (optional)
- Services list with edit/delete actions

### Step 3: Places/Locations
- Location type selection (specific/area/both)
- Google Maps integration (iframe)
- Specific address form
- Area specification form
- Places list with edit/delete actions

### Step 4: Schedules
- Already using PrimeNG (no changes needed)
- Quick setup options
- Custom schedule builder
- Timeline display of schedules

### Step 5: Service Assignment
- Drag and drop functionality (Angular CDK - preserved)
- PrimeNG cards for services and places
- PrimeNG chips for assigned services

### Step 6: Payment Setup
- Stripe integration component (no changes)

## Key Benefits
